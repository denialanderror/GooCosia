# GooCosia
## A simple Firefox extension to add a Google button to the Ecosia nav bar, because Bing is a bit poo.

Ecosia (supposedly) provides an eco-friendly alternative for searching the web, using Bing as a carbon-neutral base and planting trees with the profits. Unfortunately, Bing is pretty terrible, especially when it comes to searching with code snippets and expecting relevant Stack Overflow results to appear at the top.

This simple extention adds a Google button to the navbar that allows you to quickly re-search using the same search terms, without having to go back to the address bar and type it in again.

This has not been published as there is attribution required for the icon and I don't know the legality of it (and can't be bothered to find out). If you want to use it, either install manually or publish it yourself.

## To install:
* Open [about:debugging](about:debugging)
* Click "This Firefox"
* Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
* Select either of the files
* The plugin will stay loaded until Firefox is restarted
